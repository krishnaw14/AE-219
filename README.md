# AE-219
Supervised Learning Project - Deep Neural Networks

Exploration of Generative and latest vision based Neural Network architectures

Machine Learning Algorithms implemented:

- [x] Decision Trees
- [x] Capsule Networks (in Tensorflow and pytorch)
- [x] GANs using standard neural networks Generator and Discriminator
- [x] DCGANs on MNIST 
- [ ] SRGANs (Some bugs)
- [ ] InfoGans (Some bugs)

Currently working on Reinforcement Learning concepts and implementations
